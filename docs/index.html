        <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
        <p>My name is Rian Watson and I attend Allegheny College Class of 2024 with a Computer 
          Science Major and a Black Studies Minor. I choose to study Computer Science because I have always 
          been interested in learning about computers and being tech savvy. Also because my Aunt and Uncle are computer scientists
          so most inspiration came from watching them work. After taking a web development course I have decided that web development
          is the career path I would like to take because it would allow me to use my creativity. I choose a Black Studies minor because I am very interested in learning about Black
          history, especially since elementary and high school history books do not go deep into details about certain aspects of Black history.

        <h2><u>Mission Statement</u></h2>
        <p>I hope to combine my major and minor to create websites that schools and others can use to help educate people about 
          Black history that basic elementary and high school books do not teach. I feel like this is important because Black students 
          are mostly taught about slavery, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the Civil Rights Movement, and that's pretty much it. It does not 
          go into depth about exactly why or how the slave trade came into existence. It does not teach the truths of slavery
          and how things the Black community says and do now are connected to it. It does not teach about the historic harm picnics had 
          on Black people and exactly why they are called picnics. It does not teach about all the different activist groups
          formed during The Civil Rights Movement. There is a lot more than those books and the education system does not teach Black students,
          but these kinds of things are very important because they are our history.</p>
