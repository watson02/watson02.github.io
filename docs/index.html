          <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
          <p>My name is Rian Watson, and I attend Allegheny College, class of 2024. I am a Computer Science major
            with a minor Black Studies. I choose to study Computer Science because I have always been interested in 
            learning about computers and being tech savvy. Also because my Aunt and Uncle are computer scientists, so 
            most of my inspiration came from watching them work. After taking a web development course, I have decided that 
            web development is the career path I would like to take because it would allow me to use my creativity. 
            I choose a Black Studies minor because I am interested in learning more about Black history, especially 
            since elementary and high school history books do not go deep into details about certain aspects of Black history.

          <h2><u>Mission Statement</u></h2>
          <p>I hope to combine my major and minor to create websites that schools and others can use to help educate others about 
          Black history that basic elementary and high school books fail to acknowledge. I believe that this is important because Black students 
          are mostly taught about slavery, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the Civil Rights Movement, and that's pretty much it. It does not 
          go into depth about exactly why or how the slave trade came into existence. It does not teach the truths of slavery
          and how certain things within the Black community say and do now are connected to it. It does not teach about the historic harm things like picnics had 
          on Black people and exactly why they are called picnics. It does not teach about all the different activist groups
          formed during The Civil Rights Movement. There is a lot more that the history books and the education system does not teach others.</p>
