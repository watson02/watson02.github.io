        <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
        <p>My name is Rian Watson and I attend Allegheny College Class of 2024 with a Computer 
          Science Major and a Black Studies Minor. I choose to study Computer Science because I have always 
          been interested in learning about computers and being tech savy. Also because my Aunt and Uncle are computer scienceist
          so most inspiration came from watching them work. After taking a web development course I have decided that web development
          is the carrer path I would like to take because I would allow me to use my creativeness. I choose a Black Studies minor because I am very intrested in learning about Black
          history, expecally since I elementry and high school history books dont go deep into details about certain aspects of Black history.
        </p>

        <h2><u>Mission Statement</u></h2>
        <p>I hope to combine my major and minor to create websites that schools and others can use to help educate people about 
          Black history that basic elementry and high school books do not teach. I feel like this is important because Black students 
          are mostly taught about slavery, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the Civil Rights Movement and thats pretty much it. It does not 
          go into dept about excatly why or how slave trade came into existes. It does not teach the truths of slavery
          and how things the Black community says and do now are connected to it. It does not teach about the historic harm picnics had 
          on Black people and excatly why they are called picnics. It does not teach about all the different activist groups
          formed during The Civil Rights Movement. There is alot more that those books and the edcuation system does not teach Black students,
          but these kind of things are very important because they are our history.</p>
